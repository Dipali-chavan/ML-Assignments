# ML-Assignments
1. Data preparation
Download heart dataset from following link.  https://www.kaggle.com/zhaoyingzhu/heartcsv  Perform following operation on given dataset.
a) Find Shape of Data
b) Find Missing Values
c) Find data type of each column
d) Finding out Zero's 
e) Find Mean age of patients 
f) Now extract only Age, Sex, ChestPain, RestBP, Chol. Randomly divide dataset in training  (75%) and testing (25%).  Through the diagnosis test I predicted 100 report as COVID positive, but only 45 of those were  actually positive. Total 50 people in my sample were actually COVID positive. I have total 500  samples.  Create confusion matrix based on above data and find  I. Accuracy II. Precision III. Recall IV. F-1 score

2. Assignment on Regression technique 
Download temperature data from below link. https://www.kaggle.com/venky73/temperaturesof-india?select=temperatures.csv
This data consists of temperatures of INDIA averaging the temperatures of all places month wise. Temperatures values are recorded in CELSIUS
a. Apply Linear Regression using suitable library function and predict the Month-wise temperature.
b. Assessthe performance of regression models using MSE, MAE and R-Square metrics
c. Visualize simple regression model

3. Assignment on Classification technique
Every year many students give the GRE exam to get admission in foreign Universities. The data
set contains GRE Scores (out of 340), TOEFL Scores (out of 120), University Rating (out of 5),
Statement of Purpose strength (out of 5), Letter of Recommendation strength (out of 5),
Undergraduate GPA (out of 10), Research Experience (0=no, 1=yes), Admitted (0=no, 1=yes).
Admitted is the target variable.
Data Set Available on kaggle (The last column of the dataset needs to be changed to 0 or 1)Data
Set : https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions
The counselor of the firm is supposed check whether the student will get an admission or not
based on his/her GRE score and Academic Score. So to help the counselor to take appropriate
decisions build a machine learning model classifier using Decision tree to predict whether a
student will get admission or not.
Apply Data pre-processing (Label Encoding, Data Transformation….) techniques if
necessary.
 Perform data-preparation (Train-Test Split)
C. Apply Machine Learning Algorithm
D. Evaluate Model.

4. Assignment on Improving Performance of Classifier Models
A SMS unsolicited mail (every now and then known as cell smartphone junk mail) is any junk message
brought to a cellular phone as textual content messaging via the Short Message Service (SMS). Use
probabilistic approach (Naive Bayes Classifier / Bayesian Network) to implement SMS Spam Filtering
system. SMS messages are categorized as SPAM or HAM using features like length of message, word
depend, unique keywords etc.
Download Data -Set from : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection
This dataset is composed by just one text file, where each line has the correct class followed by
the raw message.
a. Apply Data pre-processing (Label Encoding, Data Transformation….) techniques if
necessary
b. Perform data-preparation (Train-Test Split)
c. Apply at least two Machine Learning Algorithms and Evaluate Models
d. Apply Cross-Validation and Evaluate Models and compare performance.
e. Apply Hyper parameter tuning and evaluate models and compare performance.

5. Assignment on Clustering Techniques
Download the following customer dataset from below link:
Data Set: https://www.kaggle.com/shwetabh123/mall-customers
This dataset givesthe data of Income and money spent by the customers visiting a Shopping Mall.
The data set contains Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, Spending Score. Therefore, as
a mall owner you need to find the group of people who are the profitable customers for the mall
owner. Apply at least two clustering algorithms (based on Spending Score) to find the group of
customers.
a. Apply Data pre-processing (Label Encoding , Data Transformation….) techniques if
necessary.
b. Perform data-preparation( Train-Test Split)
c. Apply Machine Learning Algorithm
d. Evaluate Model.
e. Apply Cross-Validation and Evaluate Model
